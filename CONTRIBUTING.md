## Code of Conduct

By participating in this project, you agree to abide by our Code of Conduct:

- Be respectful and inclusive
- Welcome newcomers and help them get started
- Focus on constructive criticism
- Respect differing viewpoints and experiences
- Show empathy towards other community members

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

**For Game Client (Bevy/Rust):**
- Rust 1.75.0 or later
- Cargo (comes with Rust)
- Git

**For Smart Contracts (Cairo/Starknet):**
- Scarb 2.10.1
- Katana (local Starknet devnet)
- Sozo (Dojo CLI)
- Torii (Dojo indexer)

**Optional but Recommended:**
- Docker and Docker Compose
- VS Code with Rust Analyzer and Cairo extensions

### Development Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/elysium_descent.git
   cd elysium_descent
   ```

2. **Set up the Game Client**
   ```bash
   cd client
   cargo build
   ```

3. **Set up the Smart Contracts**
   ```bash
   cd contracts
   scarb build
   ```

4. **Run the Development Environment**

   Using Docker (Recommended):
   ```bash
   docker compose up
   ```

   Or manually:
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1: Run local blockchain
   katana --dev --dev.no-fee

   # Terminal 2: Deploy contracts
   sozo build
   sozo migrate

   # Terminal 3: Run indexer (replace <WORLD_ADDRESS> with actual address)
   torii --world <WORLD_ADDRESS> --http.cors_origins "*"

   # Terminal 4: Run game client
   cd client
   cargo run
   ```

1. Use the issue template for bug reports
2. Include a clear title and description
3. Provide steps to reproduce the issue
4. Include expected vs actual behavior
5. Add system information (OS, Rust version, etc.)
6. If possible, include screenshots or error logs

### Suggesting Features

We welcome feature suggestions! Please:
1. Check if the feature has already been suggested
2. Use the feature request template
3. Clearly describe the feature and its benefits
4. Explain how it fits with the game's vision
5. Consider blockchain integration aspects if relevant

### Code Contributions

1. **Find an Issue**
   - Look for issues labeled `good first issue` or `help wanted`
   - Comment on the issue to claim it
   - Wait for maintainer approval before starting

2. **Create a Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   # or
   git checkout -b fix/issue-description
   ```

3. **Make Your Changes**
   - Write clean, documented code
   - Follow the coding guidelines
   - Add tests for new functionality
   - Update documentation as needed

## Development Guidelines

### Rust Guidelines

1. **Code Style**
   - Run `cargo fmt` before committing
   - Run `cargo clippy` and address warnings
   - Follow Rust naming conventions

2. **Performance Considerations**
   - Profile before optimizing
   - Prefer iterators over manual loops
   - Use `&str` instead of `String` when possible
   - Leverage Bevy's ECS for efficient data access

## Testing

### Client Testing
```bash
cd client
cargo test
```

### Contract Testing
```bash
cd contracts
sozo test
```

### Integration Testing
