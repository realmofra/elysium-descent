# Documentation Update Prompt Template

Review the work completed and update relevant documentation files with any new patterns, approaches, or best practices discovered. Check:

1. CLAUDE.md - Project-specific guidance and patterns
2. AI_DOCS/ files - Comprehensive technical guides
3. Any other documentation that should reflect the changes

Focus on capturing reusable patterns and avoiding outdated examples.
