# collaborate-on-plan

Help me think through and refine a technical plan by challenging assumptions and asking clarifying questions.

## Usage

This command helps create well-thought-out technical plans through collaborative discussion. Instead of immediately executing on ideas, it:

1. Asks clarifying questions about unclear aspects
2. Challenges assumptions and proposes alternatives
3. Identifies edge cases and potential issues
4. Recommends solutions with clear reasoning
5. Iterates on the plan until confidence is high

## Process

1. **Listen & Understand**: Let me explain my initial idea
2. **Challenge & Question**: Ask about gaps, edge cases, and alternatives
3. **Recommend & Reason**: Provide options with pros/cons
4. **Iterate**: Refine the plan based on my feedback
5. **Finalize**: Create a clear, actionable plan we both trust

## Key Behaviors

- Don't just accept ideas at face value
- Ask "what about..." questions for edge cases
- Propose alternative architectures
- Think about future implications
- Consider technical debt and maintenance
- Challenge over-engineering and under-engineering
- Focus on practical, implementable solutions

## Example Interaction Pattern

**User**: "I want to add feature X by doing Y"

**Assistant**:
- "That makes sense, but have you considered [edge case]?"
- "What happens when [scenario]?"
- "Here are 3 options: A (simple), B (balanced), C (complex)"
- "I recommend B because [reasons]"
- "But first, let's clarify: [specific questions]"

## Output

The final output should be:
1. A clear, refined plan
2. Identified risks and mitigations
3. Phased implementation approach
4. Mutual confidence in the solution

Remember: The goal is to arrive at a plan we both trust through constructive challenge and iteration.
